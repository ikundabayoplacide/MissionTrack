# Mission Track System

A modern web app that streamlines employee business trip ("mission") requests by replacing paper/email processes with a transparent, efficient workflow.



# Features
Digitize Requests: Employees submit missions via a simple form (destination, purpose, dates, budget, attachments).

Real-Time Tracking: Live status updates (Pending → Approved/Rejected requests).

Manager Dashboard: Review, approve/reject, and allocate budgets quickly.

Finance Visibility: Track departmental spending, validate expenses, and export reports.

Centralized Records: All requests, approvals, and expenses stored in one searchable database.

Analytics & Reporting: Automated insights (frequent destinations, top costs, approval timelines).





# User Roles

Employee: Submit requests, track status, upload expenses.

Manager: Approve/reject with notes, set budgets.

Finance: Monitor spending, validate expenses, export reports.

Admin: Configure workflows, roles, and policies.

JWT + role-based access control

Dev Tools

Docker & Docker Compose

Jest + NYC for testing/coverage

ESLint + Prettier for code quality
